2) Parent -> Node which connects to the child.
3) Child -> Node which is connected by another node is its child.
4) Leaf/Extend Node  Nodes with no children
5) Internal Node - Nodes with atleast one child.
6) 
## Depth of the Node 
Number of edges from root to that node.

Root Node depth is 0.

How far it is from the root is called depth.
Basically from root how long will it take to reach to that node.

7)
## Height of the Node 
Number of edges to the deepest node i.e. leaf node.
Basically, how many nodes are there after that node.

8)  Sibling - Nodes belonging to the same parent.

9)  Ancestors - parents or above parents.
